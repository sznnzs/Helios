## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zhenning Shi, a second-year Master's student at Tsinghua University.

I'm currently looking for:
- Ph.D. program opportunities for Fall 2026
- Research assistant positions

My recent research interests focus on making large language models work better and faster, particularly through efficient LLM inference techniques. Previously, I worked in the area of in-network machine learning. I'm passionate about finding ways to optimize how AI models perform in real-world applications!

Feel free to reach out if you're working in this area or have opportunities that might be a good fit. You can contact me at shizn23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn. I'm always open to connecting with fellow researchers and exploring collaborative projectsðŸ˜Š
